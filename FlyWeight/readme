 Flyweight Pattern â€“ Map Marker Rendering
ðŸ—º Scenario
A map application displays thousands of location markers (e.g., gas stations, restaurants, hospitals).
Each marker has unique coordinates, but many markers share the same visual style (icon, color, font).

ðŸ›  Problem Solved
Storing style data for every marker would waste a significant amount of memory.
Flyweight helps by sharing common style objects, reducing memory usage and improving performance when rendering many markers.

âœ… How Flyweight Simplified the Design
Created shared style objects (MarkerStyle), which can be reused by multiple markers instead of creating a new object for each marker.

Used a flyweight factory (MarkerFactory) to manage the creation and reuse of style objects.

Each MapMarker only stores coordinates and a reference to a shared MarkerStyle object, optimizing memory usage.

ðŸ’¡ Outcome
The application now uses significantly less memory, even with thousands of markers.

Only a small number of unique styles are created, despite a large number of markers being rendered.

Performance is improved, and marker rendering is faster, with less memory consumed for identical marker styles.
